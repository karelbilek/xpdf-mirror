This is a mirror of xpdf code. (Not whole xpdfreader, only the open source xpdf part.)

xpdf is open-source and GPLv3, but, it does not publish its code on github, just as a code dump on every version.

This is just an unofficial mirror of the code.

Please do not report here the issues of xpdf; please report them here

https://forum.xpdfreader.com/

Please report here as an issue only if the latest version is not in step with what is here.

See README for actual readme of xpdf
